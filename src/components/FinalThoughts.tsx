          The $TUPA tokenomics is designed to balance between incentivizing the community, ensuring robust market liquidity, and supporting aggressive growth strategies. By allocating a significant portion of the supply towards marketing and community rewards, $TUPA aims to establish a strong presence within the Solana ecosystem, driving long-term value for its holders.
<br /> <br /> It&apos;s also critical to have a transparent and ongoing communication strategy with the community regarding milestones, token distribution updates, and liquidity management to build trust and support around the $TUPA project.
